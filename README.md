## FAQ

1. How does the app work?
   The application aims to provide information about the current weather and suggest appropriate clothing and activities based on atmospheric conditions. After entering the location, users receive a weather forecast along with recommendations for clothing and activities for the day.

2. What weather information is available in the app?
   In my application, the following weather information is provided regarding the current conditions:
   Temperature: The current temperature at the specified location.
   Weather Description: A brief description of the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
   Sunrise and Sunset: The times of sunrise and sunset for the day.
   Humidity: The level of humidity in the air.
   Wind: Information about wind speed.
   Rainfall: The amount of rainfall recorded.
   Pressure: Atmospheric pressure at the location.
   Hourly Forecast: Predictions for the upcoming hours, typically provided in intervals of every 3 hours, including 5 timestamps, giving users insights into the expected weather changes throughout the day.

3. What clothing recommendations are provided?
   My application offers clothing suggestions tailored to the current weather conditions. However, it also takes into account the user's preferred clothing choices. If the suggested clothing item is not found in the user's wardrobe, the app will search for suitable alternatives.

   For example, if the app suggests wearing a jacket but the user does not have one in their wardrobe, it will search for similar alternatives such as a coat. This personalized approach ensures that users receive practical clothing recommendations that align with their preferences and available wardrobe options.

4. What activities are suggested by the app?
   My application provides a diverse range of activity suggestions tailored to the current weather conditions. While the activities are randomly generated, they are selected from a predefined set for each weather condition range. This ensures that the suggestions are relevant and varied, allowing users to discover new activities suited to the current weather.

For instance, on a sunny day, the app may suggest outdoor activities like hiking, cycling, or picnicking. On a rainy day, indoor activities such as cooking classes, movie marathons, or board games may be recommended. By offering a curated selection of activities for different weather conditions, users can explore new experiences and make the most of their day regardless of the weather.

5. Is the app available on mobile devices?
   Currently, the app is only available in the web version.
